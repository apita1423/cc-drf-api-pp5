### Code Used

- I relied on CI's Django REST Framework Walkthrough, with the addition of two apps: news and events.

### Acknowledgments

- Again, and for the last time, I'm truly grateful for my mentor, Martina. She has been the best mentor someone could ask for. 

- Oisin from Tutor Support, who helped with a few issues that came up. 

- My husband who has encouraged me throughout the course, and, of course, my animals who have been okay with me being in front of a computer and not being a bed for them to relax. After this I can go back to being a bed.
